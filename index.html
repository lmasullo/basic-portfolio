          I grew up in Farmingdale, NY and graduated college with a B.S. in
          Biology from the S.U.N.Y. College at Oneonta. I played varsity
          lacrosse for 4 years and was team captain my junior and senior year.
          After college I went to graduate school for Physical Therapy. I earned
          my Masters degree from the combined U.S. Army/Baylor Univerity
          program. I spent 10 years as an Army Physical Therapist. At the ripe
          old age of 35, I went to medical school at the U.T. Medical School at
          Houston. After graduation I did my residency in Emergency Medicine at
          Carl R. Darnall Army Medical Center, Fort Hood, TX. I've been an
          attending physician in the ER at Darnall since 2005.

          I've had an interest in computer programming since 1996 when I created
          a grades tracking database using MS Access and VBA. I progressed over
          the years to web development using HTML, CSS, Javascript, Coldfusion,
          and MySQL. I've created many projects, but am lacking a solid
          foundation on which to build. I am so looking forward to the next 6
          months as I learn from professionals and expand my skillset.
