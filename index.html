        <p>
          I grew up in Farmingdale, NY and graduated college with a B.S. in
          Biology from S.U.N.Y. College at Oneonta. I played varsity lacrosse
          for 4 years and was team captain my junior and senior year. After
          college I went to graduate school for Physical Therapy. I earned my
          Masters degree from the combined U.S. Army/Baylor Univerity program. I
          spent 10 years as an Army Physical Therapist. At the ripe old age of
          35, I went to medical school at the U.T. Medical School at Houston.
          After graduation I did my residency in Emergency Medicine at Carl R.
          Darnall Army Medical Center, Fort Hood, TX. I've been an attending
          physician in the ER at Darnall since 2005. I have had an interest in
          computer programming since 1996 when I created a grades tracking
          database using MS Access and VBA. I progressed to web development over
          the years using HTML, CSS, Javascript, Coldfusion, and MySQL. I've
          created many projects, but am lacking a solid foundation on which to
          build. I am som looking forward to the next 6 months as I learn from
          professionals and expand my skillset.
