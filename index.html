          I grew up in Farmingdale, NY, and graduated college with a B.S. in
          Biology from the S.U.N.Y. College at Oneonta. I played varsity
          lacrosse for 4 years and was team captain my junior and senior year.
          After college I earned my Masters degree in Physical Therapy from the
          combined U.S. Army/Baylor University program. I spent 10 years as an
          Army Physical Therapist. At the ripe old age of 35, I went to medical
          school at the U.T. Medical School at Houston. After graduation I did
          my residency in Emergency Medicine at Carl R. Darnall Army Medical
          Center, Fort Hood, TX. I've been an attending physician in the ER at
          Darnall since 2005.

          I've had an interest in computer programming since 1996 when I created
          a grades tracking database using MS Access and VBA. I progressed over
          the years to web development using HTML, CSS, Javascript, Coldfusion,
          and MySQL. I've created many projects, but am lacking a solid
          foundation. I am so looking forward to the next 6 months as I learn
          from professionals and expand my skillset.
